PHP exercises!

## Preface
This repo was for when I completed my college course CIT 228. Here, I display my completed PHP and database source code.
You might checkout the Final, where I show an authorization page and manipulating databases that I created. It's pretty cool.

I should note that I'm not a fan of PHP. In the future, don't expect more PHP projects from me.

## Installation
Unlike my previous projects, this project is more labor intensive.

You will need some kind of web server and PHP installed on said server. The one I used was a LAMP server.
There are some easy ways to do this. Shameless plug: DigitalOcean has a 'one-click install' for a LAMP server
thus will make things a whole lot easier.

How you set up your web server is completely up ot you. Just make sure you place this in the root directory of the web server
i.e. /var/www/html/ on Ubuntu defaults.

## Troubleshooting

I got nothing. If you have trouble, [email](mailto:wjmiller2016@gmail.com) me.

## Contributing

Contributions are not welcome. This repo is to show off my work done in PHP.
